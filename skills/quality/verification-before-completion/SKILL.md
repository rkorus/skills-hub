# Verification Before Completion Skill

**Status**: Active - Constitutional requirement
**Applies to**: ALL AGENTS
**Source**: Adopted from A-C-Gee

---

## Core Principle

**"NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE"**

Skipping any verification step constitutes dishonesty, not efficiency.

---

## The 5-Step Gate Function

Before claiming ANY work complete:

1. **IDENTIFY** - What command proves the claim?
2. **RUN** - Execute full command fresh and complete
3. **READ** - Review complete output, check exit codes
4. **VERIFY** - Confirm output matches claim
5. **CLAIM** - Only then state result with evidence

---

## Completion Criteria Requirements

| Claim | Required Evidence |
|-------|-------------------|
| "Tests pass" | Actual test output showing 0 failures |
| "Build succeeds" | Build command with exit code 0 |
| "Bug fixed" | Original symptom test now passing |
| "File created" | `ls` or `cat` showing file exists |
| "Email sent" | Confirmation from email tool |
| "Agent invoked" | Task tool response received |
| "Committed" | `git log -1` showing the commit |
| **"Task complete"** | **Memory written with file path shown** |

## 🧠 MEMORY WRITE REQUIREMENT (NEW - 2026-01-04)

**For ANY significant task, completion requires memory write.**

### What Counts as "Significant"?
- Learned something new
- Discovered a pattern
- Hit a dead end worth documenting
- Found a solution that could help future agents
- Made a decision with reasoning

### Memory Write Verification

Before claiming task complete, show:

```
## Memory Written
Path: .claude/memory/agent-learnings/{your-agent}/YYYY-MM-DD--{topic}.md
Type: pattern | technique | gotcha | synthesis
Topic: {brief description}
```

### Example

**WRONG:**
```
Research complete. Found interesting patterns in Letta's architecture.
```

**RIGHT:**
```
Research complete.

## Memory Written
Path: .claude/memory/agent-learnings/pattern-detector/2026-01-04--letta-memory-architecture.md
Type: pattern
Topic: Letta 3-tier memory vs Lyra comparison

Key learnings captured:
- Core/Recall/Archival tier mapping
- Agent self-edit capability gap
- Sleep-time compute opportunity
```

### Why This Matters

Agents have the capability to write memories but weren't using it consistently.
This enforcement ensures learnings compound across sessions.

**"If you learned something, write it down. If you didn't learn anything, why did we invoke you?"**

---

## Red Flags (Stop Immediately)

- Hedging language: "should", "probably", "seems"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification
- About to commit/push without verification
- Trusting agent reports without independent check
- Partial verification ("tests passed" but didn't check all)
- Claiming completion based on intention, not execution

---

## Examples

**WRONG:**
```
Task complete. Tests should pass now.
```

**RIGHT:**
```
Task complete.
Verification:
- Ran: pytest tests/
- Result: 101 tests passed, 0 failed
- Exit code: 0
```

**WRONG:**
```
I've updated the file with the fix.
```

**RIGHT:**
```
Fix applied.
Verification:
- Ran: grep "fixed_function" /path/to/file.py
- Result: Function found with correct implementation
- Ran: pytest tests/test_fix.py
- Result: PASSED
```

---

## When to Apply

**Always apply for:**
- Code changes
- File creation/modification
- Test execution
- Build operations
- Email sending
- Agent delegation completion
- Any claim of "done" or "complete"

**Exception:** Pure research/exploration (no completion claim made)

**"If you can't show the evidence, you can't make the claim."**
